    <Word Title="tutorial_girl_tournament_2">With each stage your opponents get stronger and your prize bigger.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_girl_duel_1">Duels can be fought once every 4 hours. In Duels you have to use equipment given to you instead of your own.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_girl_duel_2">Random rules will be applied to Duels from now on.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_tournament_fail_1">I know another way to earn a few coins!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_tournament_fail_2">In Survival you fight against numerous opponents. Try it!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_tournament_fail_3">The more opponents you defeat, the bigger the prize.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_bodyguard_fail_1">I'm afraid, you can't beat Brick without better equipment.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_bodyguard_fail_2">Attend the tournament and collect coins to buy better weapons and armor. You can do it!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_armor_1">Oh! Looks like you've been beaten? Your equipment is useless in this tournament.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_armor_2">It's time for you to buy some affordable armor in the store.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_armor_3">As I said, you shouldn't fight without a decent armor!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_armor_4">Listen, I can't let you go without reliable equipment.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_helmet_1">Oh my God! Look at that huge bump on your head. You can't go on without a helmet.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_buy_helmet_2">Now you have enough coins to buy one. Maybe it's time to visit the store?</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_girl_winn_tournament_1">You are awesome! Earn coins in the tournament so you can buy new gear and defeat Lynx's bodyguards.</Word>
    <Word Title="sensei_lynx_advice">Lynx is stronger than he looks! You should prepare yourself and consider upgrading your outfit before challenging him.</Word>
    <Word Title="lynx_after_fifth_guard">What weak fighters I had. Thank you for opening my eyes. Eh... as always, I'll do it all by myself.</Word>
    <Word Title="dlgRangedAvailable">Hey, look! Now you can purchase these Throwing Knives. I can hardly wait to see you hurling them!</Word>
    <Word Title="dlgMagicAvailable">At last this magnificent magic is in your reach! How about scorching something right away?</Word>
    <Word Title="endzone1_sensei_3">He he... by the time you are victorious I think I will be long gone...</Word>
    <Word Title="endzone1_sensei_4">In any case, good luck.</Word>

    <Word Title="zone2_guard1_defeated_1">Hermit only speaks to those who possesses real talent.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard1_defeated_2">You can prove said talent only if you defeat all of his disciples.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_challenge">I found a new way to earn coins! You can accept the Challenge and fight in battles with special rules.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_about_claws_1">Do you remember Lynx' weapon? He was armed with long claws, one of their kind! Oh, it would be great to get them.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_about_claws_2">You can fight him again any time you want.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard5_defeat">Well, well... You are a strong fighter... He he... Perhaps you've earned some free lessons from me.</Word>
    <Word Title="endzone2_girl_admire">Hey, we're moving on! You are so amazing! I can't stop admiring you!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_difficulty_notice">Are you sure? This battle has an Impossible difficulty. This means that you have no chance to win now.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard1_defeated_1">Ain't ya a tough one, hey? Well, ya still too boring for the Butcher.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard1_defeated_2">But his boys will surely provide you with some entertainment, know what I'm saying?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard5_defeat">What's that? Another shadow? I wonder, do shadows bleed...</Word>
    <Word Title="endzone3_girl_1">You are finally finished with those thugs! What a relief...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_wasp_greetings_1">You are here already? There are rumours of your journey, you know. But if you expect to fight me – I'm going to disappoint you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_wasp_greetings_2">Unfortunately, I no longer possess the seal you are looking for. It's been stolen from me several months ago and I've heard nothing of it ever since then.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_thief_greetings_1">Many apologies, but I happened to hear you speaking with Wasp. I understand there is certain object you wish to obtain.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_thief_greetings_2">Let's say, there is a friend of mine who knows something of this object's whereabouts.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_thief_greetings_3">I dare suggest he would happily give this object away to a person able to clear this harbour of Wasp's vile crew.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_thief_greetings_4">Defeat Wasp's men – and I'll give the seal to you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated_1">Kraken has lost and his ship is under my command now. Great team we are, right?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated_2">But Wasp has other men, you know. Off you go!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_defeated_1">So slow you are. I expected you to be finished by now. Be quick, I didn't hire you to just stand here!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_defeated_2">Take over Skipper's frigate and defeat Wasp. You'll get no payment before that.</Word>
    <Word Title="wasp_beaten">Everything is lost – all thanks to you. I guess I stayed in one place for too long. Getting rusty.</Word>
    <Word Title="thief_goodbye_1">Wonderful! I am now the only considerable force in these lands. Ah, it's tempting to keep you in my service...</Word>
    <Word Title="thief_goodbye_2">But it seems like it's not a healthy habit – having you as an enemy. Here, take the seal.</Word>
    <Word Title="thief_goodbye_3">I hope I can count on you if I will ever need a helping hand. Goodbye.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated_1">I've long forgotten what it's like to fail in combat. You are clearly different from all those peasant fools. Who do you think has caused all this mayhem? Us? Ha!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated_2">We aren't savages. Unlike those simpletons raging furiously at each other in futile hope that Widow's grace will fall upon them.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_defeated_1">Hello again! I've decided to repay you for your services back in the harbor. After all, I owe you one.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_defeated_2">Besides, surprisingly, not all citizens were quite happy about my empowerment. I'm afraid they've even become a little angered by it.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_defeated_3">So I figured that I could use some kind of protection. Against the angry mob, you know. You won't mind, do you?</Word>
    <Word Title="widow_beaten">To hell with you! Take the seal and let demons tear you apart at the Gate of Shadows!</Word>
    <Word Title="thief_congrat">What a delightful power demonstration! This gives me an idea or two... well, nevermind. I trust we can now get out of this terribly depressing place?</Word>
    <Word Title="endzone5_girl_1">We've almost reached the Gate of Shadows now. But I'm afraid of what's waiting ahead...</Word>
    <Word Title="Ambush1400_title">AMBUSH!</Word>
    <Word Title="Ambush1400_announce">Surrender your posessions or die!</Word>
    <Word Title="Ambush1400_over">Looks like they've lost their spirit! I suppose they'll think twice before attacking again.</Word>

    <Word Title="zone6_start_dialog_may_1">How strange... We've traveled so many days, and yet there are no signs of life. No people, no animals, no trees... Nothing but a huge wasteland.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_start_dialog_sensei_1">This land is close to the Gates of Shadows and has suffered greatly. I remember fertile plains once surrounded the great Ivory City...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_start_dialog_may_2">Look! That glow in the distance – it’s the Ivory City! It's burning! How can that be? It's supposed to be full of people! Can we still help them?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard1_greetings">You, there – halt! If you drop your weapons and come out where I can see, I promise you a swift and painless death.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard1_defeated_1">You... The Prince! But... But, you should be dead! It's impossible! Troops, fall back!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard1_defeated_2">Interesting... This fool seems to think you are some 'prince'. I think you should play along.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard2_greetings_1">Look, Captain! There he is, just as I said! The Prince has returned from the grave!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard2_greetings_2">Coward! I should have hanged you long ago. Step aside, so that I may deal with this beggar and prove he is no Prince.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard2_defeated_1">Mercy, o Prince! I will leave this city; I’ll never take up a weapon again, only spare my worthless life. Please, my lord!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard2_defeated_2">A Prince, huh? Have you been keeping secrets from us?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard2_defeated_3">No, this is obviously a case of mistaken identity. But, if they fear him, it is all the better.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard3_greetings">So, you are the impostor who pretends to be my master! Your deceit insults his memory. For that, you will pay!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard3_defeated_1">Forgive me for doubting you, my Prince. I fear Shogun's lies have entangled my mind.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard3_defeated_2">Tell us more about Shogun.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard3_defeated_5">You're a threat to Shogun's power. He will stop at nothing to destroy you if he finds out you’re alive. Please, my Prince, leave this city before it’s too late!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard4_defeated">My defeat will do you no good, monster. Shogun knows you are here. Whatever you are planning, he will stop you...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone_6_quest_fight_won">Ha-ha! That was the fastest running away I've seen in a while. That'll show you, losers!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_greetings_1">So... Here you are, after all of these years. What took you so long? Have you found another realm to ruin with your greed and incompetence?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_greetings_2">I see my assassins haven't failed completely. You're only a shadow of the Prince I knew.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_won">Did you really think you could match my power? I have conquered countless lands! Enslaved whole nations! Even Kings bow before me!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_defeated_1">No... This is impossible... I am invincible! I cannot lose, not now! And you... you think you can take my empire away from me? Hah!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_defeated_3">Well done, my disciple. You now have all six Seals needed to close the Gates. But don't celebrate just yet. First, we must reach the Gates...</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_greetings_1">Long time no see, Shadow. You didn't think we would just disappear, did you?</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_greetings_2">It's six against one this time. You will never reach the Gates!</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_greetings_3">When we're done with him, I get whatever is left of his body!</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_1">We were the strongest warriors who ever lived and yet we failed to defeat you...</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_2">You don't belong to this world. No one is that powerful...</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_3">Don't think you've seen the last of us. We'll meet again soon, Shadow. Until then, enjoy your victory.</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_4">Finally, we have reached the Gates of Shadows... The sight of it is hard to bear. You have everything you need to close them forever, except for one thing.</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_5">Only those made of flesh and bone can use the Seals. I would gladly do it if I were not so old. I can still shatter a brick wall with my fist, but my life energy is draining fast.</Word>
    <Word Title="shadow_gates_defeated_6">Hey, don't look at me! I like you guys, but there is no profit in dying or becoming another shadow. Good luck though!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_begin_1">May! No, this cannot be! Something has gone terribly wrong!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_begin_2">An unexpected turn of events... I'm truly sorry about your friend, Shadow.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_begin_3">This was a bad idea from the start. But now, we must open the Gates once more to save May. Any ideas?</Word>
    <Word Title="im_begin_4">The Seals! Each one appears to be connected to its owner somehow. We should revisit each owner – perhaps we will learn how to break the Seals.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_begin_5">What? Are you serious?.. Oh, what am I saying – of course you're serious... Well, Lynx is first in line, so I guess we should start there.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_lynx_greetings">So, you're back. You expect me to just sit here while you open the Gates? No, I can't let you do that! Not again!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_lynx_defeated">Ah! The voice! I still hear Titan's voice inside my head! You don't understand the power you're dealing with. You've doomed us all!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_hermit_greetings">Everyone was so afraid of my magic, but there are far more powerful forces at work here – things we don't understand, but we know they should be feared.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_hermit_defeated">Do not think that you can fully comprehend Titan's powers! He can change one's thoughts, feelings, and memories! How do you fight that?</Word>
    <Word Title="im_butcher_greetings">You think I'm the monster? You haven't seen what Titan does to his enemies... I have, and it sickens even me.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_butcher_defeated">Why do you persist? No one wants you to open the Gates. Someone will be strong enough to stop you!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_wasp_defeated">Believe me, you do not want to see what lies beyond the Gates. Forget your friend; it's not too late to turn back!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_widow_greetings">Titan's minions are like nothing you've ever seen before. You think you're prepared? It's never enough!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_widow_defeated">Titan's been leading you from the very beginning! Pulling your strings like a puppet master. Even now you do what he wishes.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_shogun_greetings">Until Titan finds the way through the Gates, this is my realm, and I will not allow you to take it from me!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_shogun_defeated">Why do you hasten your own demise? Leave now and enjoy what little time your world has left before Titan destroys you all.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_1">Now that they're taken care of, what's next?</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_2">Now it is up to Shadow. He has the tools and the experience. He is finally ready.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_3">This is suicide. I know May is your friend... but do you really want to do this?</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_4">You must go! There is no time for debate. It is now or never!</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_5">No matter what happens, it was an honor to travel with you, Shadow.</Word>
    <Word Title="im_ending_6">Have no fear, my apprentice. Your heart is pure, your resolve is strong. Trust in yourself and your training, and you cannot fail.</Word>

    <Word Title="SuccessTitle">CONGRATULATIONS!</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_bodyguard_win_1">I'm the leader of the Assassin's Order; you are not worthy of fighting me! At least your "battle" with Shin was entertaining.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_boss_hello">Who is this lowly worm before me? I'll not waste my time fighting the likes of you.</Word>
    <Word Title="tutorial_boss_hello2">Here's Shin, the weakest apprentice in my Order. First, defeat him... if you can. Perhaps then will you have the honor of fighting me.</Word>
    <Word Title="wasp_beaten_1">What have I done? Widow said everyone would kneel to me if I agreed to help her!</Word>
    <Word Title="wasp_beaten_2">She said betraying my father was the only way to show men that women should rule.</Word>
    <Word Title="wasp_beaten_3">This is not our war, but I am curious about Widow.</Word>
    <Word Title="wasp_beaten_4">Me too! She’s obviously a worthy opponent. Let’s pay her a visit, shall we?</Word>
    <Word Title="widow_beaten_1">How does it feel to defeat a woman? And you're the one who'll close the Gates of Shadows? You have no idea how quickly their power will tear you apart!</Word>
    <Word Title="widow_beaten_2">I'm feeling a bit... dizzy. Widow's spell turned me into a weak-willed, love-sick maniac! Thanks for saving me. I owe you a big one.</Word>
    <Word Title="widow_beaten_3">She's really freaking me out, guys! She's right though. I feel like something dark and terrifying is yet to come. We need to be careful!</Word>
    <Word Title="widow_beaten_4">Stay focused. The Gates of Shadows are close. There may be strange, frightening things ahead for us, but we must not fail.</Word>
    <Word Title="ZONE_2">Secret Path</Word>
    <Word Title="ZONE_4">Pirate Throne</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard2_defeated">I... I don't understand. How could one so small defeat me?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard2_greetings">Such an insignificant creature like you is hardly a challenge for me. Prepare to be crushed, little man!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard3_defeated">I am defeated? Impossible! The Order will not ignore this outrage! You will be hunted and punished, Shadow!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard3_greetings">There's nowhere for you to run, nowhere to hide. The Order will stop at nothing to defeat you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard3_greetings2">But that won't be necessary, for I shall land the killing blow and bring honor to my Master!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard4_defeated">My defeat only serves to strengthen Lynx. With each battle he learns more of your moves, your skill, and thus, how to defeat you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard4_greetings">I beat Lynx easily the first time I fought him. However, when I removed his mask I saw only a dummy.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard4_greetings2"> Then I felt his claws digging into the back of my neck. I have served him ever since.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard5_defeated">I've grown bored of this life, the Order. I wish to return to my true place, my seat of high power. But don't think that Lynx will be so easy. He will not fail!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard5_greetings">Honor and tradition? Ha! The Order is merely a playground for me, a minor amusement, a way to hone my already impressive sword skills.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_guard5_greetings2">And I am more than happy to show my skills to you now.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_lynx_greetings">You think defeating my guards proves your strength? They were weaklings, pawns, easily forgotten and replaced.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone1_lynx_greetings2">But the Order has need of one with your skill, your drive. You must choose: join us or suffer.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_begin_1">This town was known for its fighting schools, yet it lies in ruin! So much destruction... what could have done this?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_begin_2">Let's find someone who can tell us what's happened. There's a young man over there; maybe he can help.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_begin_3">You! Tell us: what's happening here?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_begin_4">You're here for Hermit's competition, no doubt. Stand in line, though you'll never get a chance to try.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard1_defeated">I can't believe you beat me... Hermit came here with nothing, yet built the best fighting school in the east!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard1_defeated2">Perhaps... humility is the lesson I must learn if I am to ever open my own school.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard1_greetings">I am the true chosen one; the only one worthy of Hermit's teachings. I will prove it and then open my own school. Prepare yourself for defeat!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard2_defeated1">You beat me – so what? Competitions are for fools, not real warriors. The only way to truly earn Hermit's knowledge is to take it by force!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard2_defeated2">You seem like a smart fighter. Want a leg up in the competition? I know Hermit's secret. You can have it... for a price.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard2_defeated2_accept">Excellent doing business with you. You won't regret it. I'll be back in a bit for delivery.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard2_defeated2_reject">Time is money, and you've just cost me both. Oh well, it's your loss.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard2_greetings">Look at the destruction one old man has brought. Imagine what I'll do with such power. Get out of my way; I must get Hermit's secret knowledge!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard3_defeated1">Heed my warnings! Magic has no place in martial arts. It dirties the mind, clouds the focus, and in the wrong hands it can bring destruction and despair.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard3_defeated2">Magic! So that is Hermit's great secret. Beware, my apprentice, magic is dangerous and powerful. It should not be used!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard3_defeated3">Sensei is right, Shadow. Magic is too dangerous to allow just anyone to have it. But you... imagine what you'll be capable of with such a power!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard3_greetings">No one should posses such power. This competition is pointless. I will win and the secret will end with me.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard4_defeated">There is no shame in being bested by a good soldier.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard4_greetings">War is the only constant – with Hermit's magic, I will conquer all who oppose me... starting with you! </Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard5_defeated1">Crane, how far you have fallen. What have you become? Forsaking the old ways? Forgetting all I have taught you? Shame on you!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard5_defeated2">Forgive me, Sensei. I have brought shame to you and to myself. Your apprentice has shown me the error of my ways.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_guard5_greetings">Sensei, my old teacher. Come to witness the new way? Your teachings are outdated, unimaginative! And this new apprentice... weak and unworthy!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_hermit_greetings">Could you be the one I have been waiting for? Let us test your skills!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone2_hermit_won">You lack focus! Pay attention now and try again.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_begin_1">Hey, guys! How's it going? I'm Bird; it's nice to meet you. Welcome to our little town.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_begin_2">How strange for this girl to walk alone at night, talking to strangers. I have a bad feeling about this.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_begin_3">Don't be so worried, old man! There's nothing fishy going on here. She's just being friendly!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_butcher_greetings">Only the strongest survive! I teach them, train them, raise them to cut and shred! Meddling fools – now I'll teach you a different lesson!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_butcher_won">You'll return over and over again until I spill every last drop of your blood. Bring it on!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard1_defeated">Please don't hurt me! I just got mixed up with the wrong people, that's all. Let me go and I promise to stop tricking travelers.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard1_greetings">Wanna see some sights? I'll show you my favorite part of town first – it'll take your breath away... once and for all.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard2_defeated1">Please have mercy! Butcher doesn't know about our relationship. He thinks love makes you weak. Please don't tell him about us!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard2_defeated2">Your fight with Hermit destroyed my business! Now everyone knows the secret.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard2_defeated3">I'll have to think of a new plan... I'll have plenty of time for that. A ship awaits me. Farewell.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard2_greetings">No; you've hurt Bird! You will pay for what you've done to my love!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard3_defeated">I don't understand. Why didn't anyone come to my aid? Could it be that Butcher... used me? No. No, I refuse to believe it!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard3_greetings">Butcher is our leader, our guiding star. Even more, he raised me from a little boy. I owe him everything. We all do!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard4_defeated1">It used to be all about having fun, breaking rules, being young. But things have changed so much. This... cult... is too serious. It's not fun anymore.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard4_defeated2">Hermit warned us about Butcher's gang, but this... this is much worse. He has been misleading children, turning them, building his own private army!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard4_defeated3">That's disgusting! How could he do such a thing? Give me your sword and I'll kill him myself!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard4_greetings">You've met Bull, that worthless fool? It was Butcher himself that killed his parents. I always thought it was a mistake letting that little brat live.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard5_defeated">My defeat means nothing. This island will be your grave. Butcher will take your life away.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone3_guard5_greetings">I hear the gentle whisper of your blood speaking to me. Come, and I will free it from that confining cocoon.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_begin_1">Have you heard anything about the place we are heading? Who is in charge?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_begin_2">Of course I've heard! Some time ago the Pirate King disappeared. His daughter, Wasp, took over and now controls this harbor.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_begin_3">It's said Wasp has a magic amulet which brings luck to its owner...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_begin_4">An amulet, you say? That sounds familiar. I wonder if that's the item we've been searching for...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_begin_5">Getting to Wasp won't be easy. She's had some trouble recently and has gone into hiding. Anyway, not my problem. A job awaits! Good luck!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated">So, you're a tough one, eh? Let's see how far you get...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated2">Ah, so you've met these "New Blood" fellas. Some of Wasp's crewmen mutinied and took over her ships.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated3">She's got a few loyal henchmen by her side, but they're still in hiding... oh, I should be going!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated4">I saw you deal with that mutineer bilge rat Kraken. You know, Wasp could use a warrior like you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_defeated5">Deal with the rest of those New Blood fools and the captain will make you rich!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard1_greetings">Who the hell are you? This port is closed. But... You've got a nice ship there – I claim it in the name of New Blood!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard2_defeated">You've chosen the wrong side, lad. When Wasp is through with you, you'll disappear just like her father! Mark my words!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard2_greetings">The Pirate King disappears without a trace, Wasp takes over, and nobody asks where her father went!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard2_greetings2">She had something to do with it, I tell ya. I don't trust that wench, and neither should you!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard3_defeated">Your strength belongs with New Blood! The Pirate King disappeared because of his ungrateful daughter – and you’re helping spread her lies!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard3_greetings">Wasp's old dogs sent you, eh? They put their money on the wrong guy. I’ll hoist you over the yardarm and you’ll sink like all the rest! </Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_defeated">We stand to lose this war because of the likes of you. Brothers killing brothers, and you profit from their suffering. You won't leave this city alive!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_greetings">So, you've dealt with the mutineers and have come for your reward?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_greetings2">Wasp was going to give you an audience until she saw you with that petty profiteer Sly! He's been selling weapons to New Blood!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_greetings3">Sly! Is this true? Have you armed their enemies?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard4_greetings4">I can explain everything! But now isn't the time... can you help a friend out here?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard5_defeated">If only the Pirate King were here – none of this would be happening! Damn that girl and her selfish acts!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_guard5_greetings">What's that silly girl gotten herself into now? If it weren't for me, Wasp would be long dead. You're just another mess for me to clean up!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_wasp_greetings">I should thank you, honestly. Before you came, I had two problems: the mutineers and my so-called "advisors" trying to restrict my control.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_wasp_greetings2">But now, thanks to you, I'm the only one in power here!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone4_wasp_won">That’s it? That’s all you’ve got? Weak! Get up and fight me for real... if you can!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_begin_1">Well, what do we have here? An interesting specimen... I've met so many men, so boring, so average. </Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_begin_2">But... There's something peculiar about this one. I'll keep my eye on you.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_begin_3">An interesting specimen? She's so full of herself! Shadow is above flattery.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_begin_4">She must be the woman Wasp spoke of. Something is... bothering me, but I am not sure what.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_begin_5">She doesn't scare me... but all these bodies do. My God, it's a slaughterhouse! And look at the damage from the siege engines!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated1">I came as a marauder, but something changed. There's a light in my heart for Widow. But I failed. I... I am not worthy of her affection.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated2">I can't forget that beautiful woman! Her face is all I see when I close my eyes.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated3">I spent all my money on a gift for her – surely, these precious gems will tell her how I feel about her.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated4">You did what? Are you feeling all right?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_defeated5">Am I all... No! No, I'm not all right! What's happening to me? This is maddening!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_greetings">Widow is my goddess! I would give all the riches in the world just to see her smile at me.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard1_greetings2">I saw the way you were looking at her... her face will be the last thing you ever see!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_defeated">She came from nowhere as we hunted. We were dumbstruck. When I finally came to my senses, blood stained my hands, and my brothers were no more...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_defeated2">All these men are vying for Widow's affection. But they're not thinking straight – they've been charmed. That's why they're attacking!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_defeated3">Sly's gone mad, too. But, Sensei, why doesn't it affect you?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_defeated4">I feel her pull, too, but I am skilled enough to resist the power.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_greetings">I'm the last of my tribe. The spirits showed me the way to the most miraculous woman I've ever seen.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard2_greetings2">I sacrificed much to attract her attention; I can't allow you to steal her from me now!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard3_defeated">Am I cursed? Love has driven me to madness and brought me to my knees, turning me into a mindless youth.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard3_defeated2">But my body can't keep up with my ambitions. I'm just a lonely, pathetic, old man.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard3_greetings">Maybe I'm not as young or strong as I used to be, but my experience will win over your arrogance! The woman will be mine.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_defeated">She has a strange power over men, beyond her beauty – it's magic! I can't resist, but I see her true nature.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_defeated2">She is cruel and evil. I'm begging you: free me from this misery!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard4_greetings">You'll go no farther. Widow has chosen me as her favored watchdog, and I am to stop anyone from coming to see her. Prepare to feel my fists!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard5_defeated">You're a perfect representative of your kind – vain and self-satisfied!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard5_defeated2">Widow will punish you and turn you into her favorite little toy. Mark my words!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard5_greetings">I don't need some magic spell to love Widow. Her power over men excites me.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_guard5_greetings2">Love is the perfect way to rob you men of your free will. But somehow you're beyond her control... so I'll fix it!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_widow_greetings">Such a powerful young man – you'll be a perfect addition to my collection.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_widow_greetings2">Fight my magic all you want; I like the struggle. No matter, I'll win and you'll stay by my side forever!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone5_widow_won">I'll be here when you're ready to try again. A worthy adversary such as yourself... we could be good friends. Or perhaps more?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_begin_5">It will be full of trickery and illusion. Take care, my disciple, and be ready for anything.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard4_greetings">You should have never returned, Prince. Did you think your former subjects would submit to you after what you did?</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard4_greetings2">Your highborn head has no place here, except on the end of a pike!</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard5_defeated">I know you have no mercy for the defeated, Prince.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_guard5_defeated2">But whatever torture you've prepared, it will not compare to the fate awaiting those who fail to carry out Shogun's will.</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_shogun_defeated_2">They used your name to scare children, yes. But I brought them order; I gave them the Empire! My people won't follow a petty prince now...</Word>
    <Word Title="zone6_start_dialog_sensei_2">Perhaps, but we must be careful. No natural fire can burn so long; this realm belongs to the shadows now.</Word>
